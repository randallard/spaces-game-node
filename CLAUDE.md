- make sure coverage is kept high for any new code that is added
- make sure all new code has good test coverage
- do not push until I've verified locally
- never hardcode endpoints - always set up to be configurable in environment or config files
- always let me know if I need to restart the dev server or need to start with fresh local storage or just need to start with a fresh game
