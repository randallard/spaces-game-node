when the player clicks to add an opponent, they should be presented with a name field to enter the name they want to call their friend - this is just for our list - the friend will get to choose their own name for themself and the player doesn't need to send them their own name either, so adding an opponent is just setting a name and adding them to the list like a CPU opponent.  Human opponent play buttons are restricted to round by round and 2x2 or 3x3 boards for the first game until you've completed one game with them, then they can be unrestricted according to whatever else is unlocked for the player.  
so after a player has added an opponent they have another opponent in their list with the CPU opponents and when they click that play button it starts a game exactly like with the CPU but after they choose the board, instead of going to the results, it generates a share button so they can share the board they've chosen, and the game state. 
These instructions are primary but use MINIMAL-BOARD-ENCODING.md as an additional guide - do not implement QR code - just options 1 and 2 from that section.
